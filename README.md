# Modulus Meme Generator
 A file generator for the hardcoded "is a number odd or even" meme.
 
 Inspiration for the project: The Primeagen's reaction to a bait article of a 4 Billion entry "odd" or "even" file

## Python
 - First attempt at the generator
 - Has more tweakable settings (pointless)
 - Didn't compile into an exe so it's slower than it could have been

## C++
 - Have more experience in C++
 - Have a threadpool library I know how to use
 - wrote to not have any tweakable settings
